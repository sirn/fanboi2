Installation
------------

Fanboi2 has the following runtime requirements:

- `Python 3.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ with `Virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_
- `PostgreSQL 10 <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_
- `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_
- `Memcached <https://memcached.org/>`_

Additionally, the following packages are build-time requirements for compiling assets:

- `Node 8 <https://nodejs.org/>`_ (Node 10 will NOT work)
- `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/>`_

After all packages are installed, you may now setup the application::

  $ git clone https://github.com/forloopend/fanboi2.git fanboi2
  $ cd fanboi2/
  $ make all -j2

Then configure ``.env`` according to the configuring section below, then run::

  $ make migrate
  $ make serve

You also need to run the worker (in another terminal) with::

  $ make worker

And you're done! Please visit `http://localhost:6543/admin/ <http://localhost:6543/admin/>`_ to perform initial configuration.

Configuring
-----------

Fanboi2 uses environment variable to configure the application. In case ``make`` is used, you can create a file named ``.env`` in the root directory of the project and our make configuration will happily use it up on ``make serve`` or ``make devserve``. Otherwise you may want to use something like `Direnv <https://github.com/direnv/direnv>`_.

========================= =========================================================================
Key                       Description
========================= =========================================================================
``AUTH_SECRET``           **Required**. Secret for authentication/authorization cookie.
``CELERY_BROKER_URL``     **Required**. Redis URL for Celery broker, e.g. `redis://127.0.0.1/1`
``DATABASE_URL``          **Required**. Database URL, e.g. `postgres://127.0.0.1/fanboi2`
``MEMCACHED_URL``         **Required**. Memcached URL, e.g. `127.0.0.1:11211`
``REDIS_URL``             **Required**. Redis URL, e.g. `redis://127.0.0.1/0`
``SESSION_SECRET``        **Required**. Secret for session cookie. Must not reuse ``AUTH_SECRET``.
``GEOIP_PATH``            Path to GeoIP database, e.g. `/usr/share/geoip/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`
``SERVER_DEV``            Boolean flag whether to enable dev console, default `False`
``SERVER_SECURE``         Boolean flag whether to only authenticate via HTTPS, default `False`.

Contributing
------------

Fanboi2 is open to any contributors, whether you are learning Python or an expert. To contribute to Fanboi2, it is highly recommended to use `Vagrant`_ as it is currently replicating the production environment of `Fanboi Channel`_ and perform all the necessary setup steps for you. Alternatively, if containers are your thing, you can find experimental, unsupported Docker Compose scripts in ``contrib/``.

Vagrant
^^^^^^^

1. Install `Vagrant`_ of your preferred platform.
2. Install `VirtualBox`_ or other providers supported by Vagrant.
3. Run `vagrant up` and read Getting Started while waiting.
4. Run `vagrant ssh` to SSH into the development machine (remember to ``cd /vagrant``).

In case you do not want to use Vagrant, you can install the dependencies from the installation section and run::

  $ make dev
  $ make devhook

You can then configure the application (see configuration section) and run the server::

  $ make migrate
  $ make devrun

Docker
^^^^^^

1. Install ``Docker`` and ``Docker Compose``
2. Copy Compose configuration files to the application's parent directory (``cp contrib/docker-compose.* ../``)
3. Modify the content of ``docker-compose.yml``

   1. Generate both ``AUTH_SECRET`` and ``SESSION_SECRET`` tokens with ``openssl rand -hex 32``
   2. Set a sensible PostgreSQL password
   3. This config assumes fanboi2 was cloned to ``fanboi2``; update the build and mount paths if untrue

4. Start the contraption with ``docker-compose up`` from the same directory as the config files.

By default, Fanboi2 will start in development mode which aids debugging. To disable development server capabilities, remove or rename the file ``docker-compose.override.yml``.

Submitting Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you've made your changes, simply open a `pull request <https://github.com/forloopend/fanboi2/pulls>`_ against the **master** branch. Our reviewer will review and merge the pull request as soon as possible. It would be much appreciated if you could follow the following guidelines:

- When making a non-trivial changes, please create `an issue <https://github.com/forloopend/fanboi2/issues>`_ prior to starting.
- Make sure new features has enough tests and no regressions.
- Fix any offenses as reported by pre-commit hooks.

Workflow
--------

Fanboi2 uses a ``Makefile``-based workflow in its development and production cycle. You are encourage to use ``make`` rather than directly invoking underlying commands. The provided ``Makefile`` can be customized to certain extent using environment variable, such as:

========================= =========================================================================
Key                       Description
========================= =========================================================================
``VERBOSE=1``             Prints the underlying command when running ``make``.
``VIRTUALENV=virtualenv`` Specifies the ``virtualenv`` binary (e.g. ``virtualenv-3.6`` for BSDs)
``YARN=yarn``             Specifies the ``yarn`` binary.
``VENVDIR=.venv``         Specifies the virtualenv directory.
``ENVFILE=.env``          Specifies the file containing environment variable to load from.
========================= =========================================================================

The following make targets are available for use in production:

- ``make all`` build the application and assets using production configurations.
- ``make prod`` build the application using production configuration.
- ``make serve`` run the application server.
- ``make worker`` run the application worker.
- ``make assets`` build assets.
- ``make migrate`` migrate daabase.
- ``make clean`` remove everything.

The following make targets are available for use in development:

- ``make dev`` builds the application using development configuration.
- ``make devrun`` run the development application server, application worker and assets watcher.
- ``make devhook`` install development pre-commit hook to the repository.
- ``make devserve`` run the development application server.
- ``make devassets`` run the development assets watcher.

The following make targets are available for use in test environment:

- ``make test`` run tests.

Most of these commands make use of `VENVDIR` and `ENVFILE`.

The Adventurous Way
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If using ``make`` is not your thing, you can set everything up manually, for example on macOS [1]_::

  $ brew install python@3 node@8 yarn

Create the deploy environment::

  $ mkdir -p $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv
  $ virtualenv new -p python3 $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv
  $ git clone https://github.com/forloopend/fanboi2.git $HOME/dev/fanboi2/src

Setup the application::

  $ cd $HOME/dev/fanboi2/src
  $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/pip3 install -e .[dev,test]
  $ yarn install
  $ yarn run gulp
  $ vi $HOME/dev/fanboi2/envfile

Configure ``envfile`` then::

  $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/alembic upgrade head
  $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/fbctl serve --reload

In another terminal, run the worker::

  $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/fbcelery worker

Also install ``pre-commit-hook`` if you want to contribute to the project::

  $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/pre-commit install
