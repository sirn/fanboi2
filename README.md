# Fanboi2

[![python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html) [![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2/freebsd.yml.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2/freebsd.yml?)

Board engine behind [Fanboi Channel](https://fanboi.ch/) written in Python.

## Installation

For production environment, Fanboi2 has the following runtime requirements:

-   [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io)
-   [PostgreSQL 10](https://www.postgresql.org/)
-   [Redis](https://redis.io/)

Additionally, the following packages are build-time requirements for compiling assets:

-   [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/) (Node 10 will NOT work)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

After all packages are installed, setup the application with:

    $ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2 fanboi2
    $ cd fanboi2/
    $ poetry install --no-dev
    $ yarn install && yarn run gulp

Then configure environment variables according to the configuring section below, and run:

    $ poetry run alembic upgrade head
    $ poetry run fbctl serve

You also need to run the worker (each in its own terminal window) with:

    $ poetry run fbcelery worker
    $ poetry run fbcelery beat

And you're done! Please visit <http://localhost:6543/admin/> to perform initial configuration.

## Configuring

Fanboi2 uses environment variable to configure the application. You may want to use something like [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) to manage these environment variables.

-   `AUTH_SECRET` -- **Required**. Secret for authentication/authorization cookie.
-   `CELERY_BROKER_URL` -- **Required**. Redis URL for Celery broker, e.g. redis://127.0.0.1/1
-   `DATABASE_URL` -- **Required**. Database URL, e.g. postgres://127.0.0.1/fanboi2
-   `REDIS_URL` -- **Required**. Redis URL, e.g. redis://127.0.0.1/0
-   `SESSION_SECRET` -- **Required**. Secret for session cookie. Must not reuse `AUTH_SECRET`.
-   `GEOIP_PATH` -- Path to GeoIP database, e.g. /usr/share/geoip/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
-   `SERVER_DEV` -- Boolean flag whether to enable dev console, default False
-   `SERVER_SECURE` -- Boolean flag whether to only authenticate via HTTPS, default False.

## Development

To setup Fanboi2 in development mode, run the following commands after performing production setup steps:

    $ poetry install

And run the server with (each in its own terminal window):

    $ poetry run fbctl serve --reload --workers=1 --threads=4
    $ yarn run gulp watch
