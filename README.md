# Fanboi2

[![python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html)
[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2/freebsd.yml.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2/freebsd.yml?)

Board engine behind [Fanboi Channel](https://fanboi.ch/) written in Python.

## Installation

Fanboi2 has the following runtime requirements:

-   [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
-   [PostgreSQL 10](https://www.postgresql.org/)
-   [Redis](https://redis.io/)

Additionally, the following packages are build-time requirements for compiling assets:

-   [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/) (Node 10 will NOT work)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

After all packages are installed, you may now setup the application:

    $ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2 fanboi2
    $ cd fanboi2/
    $ make all -j2

Then configure `.env` according to the configuring section below, then run:

    $ make migrate
    $ make serve

You also need to run the worker (in another terminal) with:

    $ make worker

And you're done! Please visit <http://localhost:6543/admin/> to perform initial configuration.

## Configuring

Fanboi2 uses environment variable to configure the application. In case `make` is used, you can create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and our make configuration will happily use it up on `make serve` or `make devserve`. Otherwise you may want to use something like [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv).

| Key                 | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH_SECRET`       | **Required**. Secret for authentication/authorization cookie.          |
| `CELERY_BROKER_URL` | **Required**. Redis URL for Celery broker, e.g. redis://127.0.0.1/1    |
| `DATABASE_URL`      | **Required**. Database URL, e.g. postgres://127.0.0.1/fanboi2          |
| `REDIS_URL`         | **Required**. Redis URL, e.g. redis://127.0.0.1/0                      |
| `SESSION_SECRET`    | **Required**. Secret for session cookie. Must not reuse `AUTH_SECRET`. |
| `GEOIP_PATH`        | Path to GeoIP database, e.g. /usr/share/geoip/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb    |
| `SERVER_DEV`        | Boolean flag whether to enable dev console, default False              |
| `SERVER_SECURE`     | Boolean flag whether to only authenticate via HTTPS, default False.    |

## Contributing

Fanboi2 is open to any contributors, whether you are learning Python or an expert. To contribute to Fanboi2, it is highly recommended to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as it is currently replicating the production environment of [Fanboi Channel](https://fanboi.ch/) and perform all the necessary setup steps for you. Alternatively, if containers are your thing, you can find experimental, unsupported Docker Compose scripts in `vendor/docker/`.

### Vagrant

1.  Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) of your preferred platform.
2.  Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or other providers supported by Vagrant.
3.  Run vagrant up and read Getting Started while waiting.
4.  Run vagrant ssh to SSH into the development machine (remember to `cd /vagrant`).

In case you do not want to use Vagrant, you can install the dependencies from the installation section and run:

    $ make dev
    $ make devhook

You can then configure the application (see configuration section) and run the server:

    $ make migrate
    $ make devrun

### Docker

1.  Install `Docker` and `Docker Compose`
2.  Copy Compose configuration files to the application's parent directory (`cp vendor/docker/docker-compose.* ../`)
3.  Modify the content of `docker-compose.yml`
    1.  Generate both `AUTH_SECRET` and `SESSION_SECRET` tokens with `openssl rand -hex 32`
    2.  Set a sensible PostgreSQL password
    3.  This config assumes fanboi2 was cloned to `fanboi2`; update the build and mount paths if untrue
4.  Start the contraption with `docker-compose up` from the same directory as the config files.

Images are published to [sirn/fanboi2](https://hub.docker.com/r/sirn/fanboi2/) on GitHub for every commit in master. By default, using Fanboi2 with the default `docker-compose.yml` will start server in development mode which aids debugging. To disable development server capabilities, remove or rename the file `docker-compose.override.yml`.

### Submitting changes

To submit patches to mailing list:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2`
2.  Make the necessary changes.
3.  Configure Git sendmail address: `git config sendemail.to ~sirn/fanboi2-dev@lists.sr.ht`
4.  Create a patch: `git format-patch -1 HEAD` (refer to `git-format-patch(1)` for more info)
5.  Send a patch: `git send-email -1` (refer to `git-send-email(1)` for more info)

To submit patches via [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/sirn/fanboi2):

1.  Fork the repository using "Fork" button on the top right of the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sirn/fanboi2).
2.  Make the necessary changes.
3.  Submit pull request against the **master** branch.

Submitting patches via mailing list is recommended in case you wish to remain anonymous (e.g. using thrown-away email address). GitHub, on the other hand, require you to create account with them and [GitHub terms of service explicitly forbids having more than one account](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#b-account-terms). Whether method you choose, our reviewer will review and merge the patch as soon as possible. It would be much appreciated if you could follow the following guidelines:

-   When making a non-trivial changes, please first discuss in the [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2-dev) or in the [development thread](https://fanboi.ch/meta/).
-   Make sure new features has enough tests and no regressions.
-   Fix any offenses as reported by pre-commit hooks.

## Workflow

Fanboi2 uses a `Makefile`-based workflow in its development and production cycle. You are encourage to use `make` rather than directly invoking underlying commands. The provided `Makefile` can be customized to certain extent using environment variable, such as:

| Key                     | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `VERBOSE=1`             | Prints the underlying command when running `make`.                 |
| `VIRTUALENV=virtualenv` | Specifies the `virtualenv` binary (e.g. `virtualenv-3.6` for BSDs) |
| `YARN=yarn`             | Specifies the `yarn` binary.                                       |
| `VENVDIR=.venv`         | Specifies the virtualenv directory.                                |
| `ENVFILE=.env`          | Specifies the file containing environment variable to load from.   |

The following make targets are available for use in production:

-   `make all` build the application and assets using production configurations.
-   `make prod` build the application using production configuration.
-   `make serve` run the application server.
-   `make worker` run the application worker.
-   `make assets` build assets.
-   `make migrate` migrate daabase.
-   `make clean` remove everything.

The following make targets are available for use in development:

-   `make dev` builds the application using development configuration.
-   `make devrun` run the development application server, application worker and assets watcher.
-   `make devhook` install development pre-commit hook to the repository.
-   `make devserve` run the development application server.
-   `make devassets` run the development assets watcher.

The following make targets are available for use in test environment:

-   `make test` run tests.

Most of these commands make use of VENVDIR and ENVFILE.

### The Adventurous Way

If using `make` is not your thing, you can set everything up manually, for example on macOS:

    $ brew install python@3 node@8 yarn

Create the deploy environment:

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv
    $ virtualenv new -p python3 $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv
    $ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sirn/fanboi2 $HOME/dev/fanboi2/src

Setup the application:

    $ cd $HOME/dev/fanboi2/src
    $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/pip3 install -e .[dev,test]
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn run gulp
    $ vi $HOME/dev/fanboi2/envfile

Configure `envfile` then:

    $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/alembic upgrade head
    $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/fbctl serve --reload

In another terminal, run the worker:

    $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/fbcelery worker

Also install `pre-commit-hook` if you want to contribute to the project:

    $ $HOME/dev/fanboi2/venv/bin/pre-commit install
